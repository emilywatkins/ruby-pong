## Description

This simple application takes a number from the user, creates an array beginning with 1 and ending with the user's input number. It then replaces numbers that meet certain criteria with either ping or pong and, finally, returns a list of numbers where ping and pong have been inserted.

## Specs

1. Collect input from user. The terminal will be able to output the number.
  Input: 60
  Output: 60

2. Program will count from 1 to the user input number and output an array of those numbers.
  Input: 4
  Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

3. Program will replace numbers divisible by 3 with "ping"
  Input: 4
  Output: [1, 2, "ping", 4]

4. Program will replace numbers divisible by 5 with "pong"
  Input: 5
  Output: [1, 2, "ping", 4, "pong"]
